# Play-Perceptron
Perceptron Playground on Logical Operator<br>
Change your point of view of how perceptron works<br>
Instead of thinking *line in 2D*, let's think of *plane in 3D*<br>
increase `w1` => increase the plane slope in x1 direction<br>
increase `w2` => increase the plane slope in x2 direction<br>
increase `b` => lift the whole plane upwards<br>
